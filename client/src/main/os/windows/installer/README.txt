In order to use the NSIS installer we need to instal
- nsis-2.46-setup.exe or greater (obviously)
- AccessControl.zip - to request admin permissions for install
- Inetc.zip - to send metrics to our web tracker
- IpConfig.zip - to gather nwtork information
- ZipDLL.zip - to uncompress the installation files

The plugins must be uncrompressed into the nsis installed folder
